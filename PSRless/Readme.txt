It happens that some forums are governed by purists. All you have to do if you 
want to submit your package is to conform to their proclaimed standards.

Of course, this is not the case of phpclasses.org, which prefers creativity
to strict obedience. But sometimes, your works can spread over more than one
site.

This is why the files in this package have been made conformant to the PSR-2
stuff (http://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-2).

The files in this directory are the original files, the way I wrote them.
They are only conformant to my style of writing and creativity...

Chose whatever version you like, but please know that the files in THIS
directory are to be considered as the real original ones.
